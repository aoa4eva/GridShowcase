			<h1>This is a sample page</h1>
			<div class="col-sm-12">
					<!-- A row is introduced here. It has one cell spanning three columns, another spanning 6 columns and another spanning 3 columns. -->
					<div class="row">
						<div class="col-sm-3">
						<!--This cell can accommodate a number of items. Note that it can be as long as is required. This will NOT make the next cell the same height  -->
								<h2>First Image</h2>
								<h2>Second Image</h2>
								<h3>Third image</h3>
								So many things are going on here that you really want to take them in one at a time. 
								Look at each row to see how it is structured. 
						</div>
						<div class="col-sm-6">
						<!-- This row contains a lot of text, and therefore extends the height of the cell in the middle. -->
							<h1 class="text-center">Go ahead and put something in the middle</h1>
							<div class="col-sm-6 col-sm-offset-3">
							<h3 class="text-center">This is text that should go all the way down.</h3>
							<p class="text-center">I am structuring the page so it can accept a lot of text without looking like there is something missing. CSS is not easy to master, but once you  have the fundamentals, you can work with it to display elements with properties you thought would never go together. Stick it out, it's worth the journey!</p>
